        <p>LEP Waste to Energy Pty (LEP) was established in 2010 to develop a Waste to Energ in NSW (the Project). 
          <br>
          <br>
          The concept design for the Project contemplates the use of plasma gasification technology for the destruction of 150,000 tonnes pa of municipal solid waste (MSW) to produce 30MW of electrical energy.  Given the proposed location of the Project, there is sufficient waste arising within the transportation footprint of the Project to provide sufficient MSW. The concept design for the Project provides for a smaller footprint than other thermal treatment technologies, with greater mass to electrical energy yields, and lower levels of emissions and solid residue.  The Project is on a 2021 to 2023 consenting and construction timeline.
