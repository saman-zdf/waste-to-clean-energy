        <h4>1.	Summary</h4>
          <p>Plasma based W2E projects have met    with varying degrees of success around the world, with a number of projects being abandoned. Ref 1 provides some details, but is not comprehensive, for instance, it makes no reference to the successful Cheongsong 10Te/day plant in Korea, which has successfully destroyed MSW and produced syngas and an inert slag for many years 
            <br>
            <br>
            This review seeks to establish why this should be the case, and how and why LEP’s selected Plasma technology will overcome the past challenges. Plasma Torches have been extensively used on advanced chain grate installations to destroy residual toxins in the flue gas and is often referred to as “flue gas polishing”. Ref 7 presents a comparison of key metric between advanced chain grates and LEP’s proposed plasma-based plant.
          </p>
          <h4>2.	Scientific basis for the use of Plasma waste destruction</h4>
          <p>Plasma (Ref 2) is referred to as the “Fourth State of Matter”, and consists of a gas of ions. It can be artificially created by means of plasma torches, which form an electrical arc that in conjunction with a flow of carrier inert gas, such as nitrogen, generates a directed flow of plasma.  The very high temperatures, typically in excess of +30000 C, generated within the plasma converts introduced organic material into syngas, which is primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide. All inorganic materials melt in the plasma jet and flow down the refractory sides of the plasma reaction vessel, where they are then removed, quenched and crushed to produce an inert vitrified slag. The fact that there is no leaching means is an ideal material for construction fill purposes.
            The high temperature and the lack of oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as Furans, Dioxins, nitrogen oxides, which along with rapid quenching and scrubbing of the syngas, results in extremely low levels of toxic emissions.
          </p>
          <h4>3.	Plasma Transfer and Non transfer Torches in Waste Destruction Applications</h4>
          <p>There are two types of DC torches: non-transferred and transferred. In non-transferred DC torches, the electrodes are inside the body/housing of the torch itself (creating the arc there). Whereas in a transferred torch one electrode is outside (and is usually the conductive material to be treated), allowing the arc to form outside of the torch over a larger distance.
            <br>
            <br>
            In W2E applications transfer torches are typically used to heat a coke bed to which the waste material is added. This creates significant problems with acid corrosion of both the torches and the plasma reaction vessel in the handling of the slag. The use of coke beds has been adopted with the aim increasing the syngas production by means of pyrolysis type chemical reactions. In some instances, the plasma torches have also been placed in the lower part of the reaction vessel. The temperatures achieved in these configurations are typically only 800-9000C, as compared to +30000C achieved in SM’s proposed process. These lower temperatures have in a number of projects required an additional reaction vessel and plasma torches to destroy the toxic gases emitted by the pyrolysis reaction.
            <br>
            <br>
            LEP believes the inclusion of a pyrolysis process, along with the plasma heating has been a major contributor to the failure of a number of the projects due to corrosion and poor operational performance.
            In the case of the Advanced Plasma Power Project in Swindon in the UK, it had adopted a two-stage configuration. Vessel 1 had a coke bed onto which the MSW was fed and transfer troches for heating. The second vessel was included for gas clean up using plasma torches. The plant was shut down, and closed due to corrosion of the plasma torches. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The Air Product’s Plant on Teesside in the UK utilised a single large vessel scaled up from a test rig by a factor of 35. Again, it is believed that it used a coke bed and fed the MSW directly onto the bed. Transfer torches provided the heating and were believed to have been located in the roof and sides of the vessel. Air Products shutdown the 1st Plant shortly after start-up due to severe corrosion in the wall of the vessel. It further abandoned the 2nd plant before start-up, and took a write-down of GBP 900m. No reasons were given as to the details behind the decision. However. Trade Union officers made public the basis cause of the failure.
            <br>
            Given the above experiences LEP will not adopt a pyrolysis type process, but will rely on conductive paths in the plasma chamber for the application of the Tetronics transfer torch technology. This will be tested in the forthcoming test programme.
          </p>
          <h4>4.	The Cheongsong Korean Plant Experience</h4>
          <p>The Cheongsong Plasma Based MSW processing plant deploys a very similar plasma torch configuration as that proposed by SM. The shredded MSW is fed directly into the plasma created by a number of non-transfer plasma torches.
            <br>
            Ref 5 reviews the design and operating experience of the Cheongsong 10Te/day W2E plant. The key items of note are as <span>follows</span>:-
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul class="tech-lists">
            <li>The plant used two non-transferred plasma torches rated at 200 KW each. These were mounted at <span>30<sup>o</sup> degree </span> angle to induce a centrifugal swirl in the reaction vessel thereby promoting the transfer of the melted inorganic material to the wall of the vessel where it then flows to the bottom for tapping and quenching</li>
            <li>The bulk temperature within the vessel was 1400<sup>o</sup> C. </li>
            <li>The waste material was presented to the feeder having previously passed through a magnetic separator, a crusher to reduce the waste size to 20 cm, a storage hopper, and a conveyor to the hydraulic feeder (20 Kgs /stroke) </li>
            <li>The molten slag was quenched and produced a granular slag. </li>
            <li>The syngas was quenched and scrubbed, resulting in the removal of virtually all acidic gases.</li>
            <li>The percentage of slag measured over 3 months was 7.5% of the waste material.</li>
            <li>The fly ash collected in the bag filters was 9.5Kg/Waste Te. (0.95%) with only 0.24% carbon present.The fly ash collected in the bag filters was 9.5Kg/Waste Te. (0.95%) with only 0.24% carbon present.</li>
            <li>Fly ash analysis indicated that inorganic material volatized in the reaction vessel had condensed onto particulate material collected in the bag filters</li>
            <li>Analysis of the flue gas emissions showed that dioxins and furans were much lower at 0.05 ng-TEQ/Nm<sup>3</sup> compared to 5.75ng-TEQ/Nm<sup>3</sup> in conventional incineration plants. Full details of the flue gas analysis are given in Ref 7 Table 2. </li>
            <li>The plant was built and commissioned in 12 months, and has reliably operated for a number of years</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>5.LEP’s Selected Plasma Torches and their Application</h4>
          <p>LEP is currently reviewing two plasma torch suppliers, namely Tetronics with their transfer torches, and Phoenix Solutions Co’s (PSC’S) non-transferred torches. Regardless of which torch type is selected, the processed waste will be introduced directly into the plasma jet. The waste will have a residence time in the reaction vessel of approximately 1.3 seconds. The fundamental advantages are the rapid processing of the organic waste and the ease of handling and tapping the inorganic slag. This is supported by both Tetronics and PSC’s worldwide experience in plasma destruction of hazardous wastes (Ref 4).  The proposed reaction vessel will have three 900 Kw torches installed in the roof of the vessel and the waste stream will be introduced by a feeder and fall by gravity into the plasma jet. The torches are capable of being articulated so as to control and adjust the reaction in the plasma jet. Air, and steam can be admitted as required to optimise the conditions and the yield of syngas. The slag is tapped at the bottom of the vessel. In PSC’s vortex-stabilised torches, the anodes have an operating life of approx. 3000 hours, whilst the cathodes has an operating life of approx. 600 hrs, but can be easily replaced within 30 mins, thereby minimising down-time. Tetronics’ torches are transfer torches and have much longer operating lives due to on-line replacement of the <span>cathodes</span>.</p>
          <h4>6.LEP’s Testing Programmes</h4>
          <p>LEP conducted a series of tests at PSC’s test rig in the USA, utilising a mixed waste stream including a significant proportion of biological material. The tests were entirely successful, and were witnessed by an Independent Engineer (Ref 8), who reported that the tests were entirely successful in confirming the proposed process.
            <br>
            A further test programme in Feb 2020 was undertaken by LEP/SM, based on waste streams containing plastics and cardboard, which are readily available as feedstock. It is now intended to conduct a similar series of tests with Tetronics in Oct/Nov 2020, so as to validate Tetronics as a torch and technology supplier.
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>  The following details set out the outputs from the testing programmes, along with their use for the design and consenting of the proposed full-scale plant.</p>
          <ul class="tech-lists">
            <li>Confirm the suitability of the selected waste stream for a large-scale W2E plant.</li>
            <li>Design data for the final design of the full-scale plasma vessels for the LEP W2E project.</li>
            <li>Mass Energy Balances (MEB) for the test, thereby allowing extrapolation to the MEB’s for full-scale plant. This in turn provides the data for the design of the power generation island. </li>
            <li>Demonstrate the stability of the plasma with the selected waste stream composites. </li>
            <li>Chemical analysis of the resultant syngas and the slag and char. These form the basis of the design specification of the scrubber and quench towers for the full-scale plant. The specification is to be provided by PSC.</li>
            <li>Confirm the expected emissions from the full-scale plant, and in particular the near elimination of hazardous emissions such as dioxins and furans.</li>
            <li>Provide a reliable projection of the full-scale plant emissions for dispersal modelling and consenting purposes.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate the vitrification of all inorganic materials in the waste composites, along with its chemical analysis. </li>
            <li>Chemical analysis of any char collected in the bag filters, thereby allowing the design of the bag filters for the full-scale plant.</li>
            <li>Provide data for the estimation of GHG emissions from the full-scale plant.</li>
            <li>Provide data for the design of the scrubber and quench waste water treatment plant. </li>
            <li>Confirmation by the Independent Engineer and Laboratory of the validity of all these results. </li>
          </ul>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>
            Both PSC and Tetronics have a large amount of confidence based on their experience in utilising sophisticated modeling tools to extrapolate the test results to inform the designs of the full-scale LEP plant. Each of the LEP plasma trains will be a factor or 10 scale-up from the plasma vessel used for the above-mentioned test programms. Such a scale up is well within their past experience.

        <div class="tech-info">
          <p>It should be noted that LEP’s plasma technology route results in much lower (a factor of 10) flue gas emissions (Dioxins and Furans) and solid waste generation than the Chain Grate technology, along with using less land for the Plant, and as such will represent “World’s Best Practice” in to Environmental Impact and Footprint.</p>
          <h4><span>Competitive Advantage Summary</span></h4>
          <p>The LEP direct plasma gasification of waste and conversion to energy provides a much smaller environmental footprint than competing technologies, whilst delivering market-level financial and socio-economic benefits.  
            Our substantially lower environmental footprint will establish best practice for the industry globally, as required by Regulators and Governments.
